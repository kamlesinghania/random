Function Name: categorize_sentiment

Purpose: To categorize the overall sentiment of a text into one of five categories: "Strongly Positive", "Weakly Positive", "Neutral", "Weakly Negative", or "Strongly Negative", based on the calculated average confidence scores for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

Input:

A dictionary containing average confidence scores for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Example: {'positive': 0.7, 'neutral': 0.2, 'negative': 0.1}
Processing Logic:

Define Thresholds: Set thresholds to differentiate between strong and weak sentiments. For example, a threshold might be set at 0.6 for strong sentiments.
Compare Scores:
If one of the scores (positive, neutral, negative) significantly outweighs the others, categorize the sentiment as strongly in that direction.
If the scores are more balanced but one is slightly higher, categorize the sentiment as weakly in that direction.
If the neutral score is high and there's no clear leaning towards positive or negative, categorize as neutral.
Special Cases:
If the positive and negative scores are very close to each other and relatively high, but the neutral score is low, categorize as "Mixed".
Adjust logic based on specific business needs or observations from data.
Output:

A string representing the sentiment category. One of: "Strongly Positive", "Weakly Positive", "Neutral", "Weakly Negative", "Strongly Negative", or "Mixed".
