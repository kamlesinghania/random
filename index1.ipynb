    "[1278] ## PURPOSE\n",
    "[1279] \n",
    "[1280] This report proposes one motion for consideration at the Local Government Association of Queensland's (LGAQ's) 2024 Annual Conference.\n",
    "[1281] \n",
    "[1282] Draft motions are prepared for Council's review and endorsement prior to the Annual Conference to be held in October 2024.\n",
    "[1283] \n",
    "[1284] \n",
    "[1285] ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
    "[1286] \n",
    "[1287] The 2024 LGAQ Annual Conference is to be held in Brisbane from 21 to 23 October.\n",
    "[1288] \n",
    "[1289] Each year, the Conference debates motions put forward by both the LGAQ Policy Executive and member Councils. Motions that are supported and resolved at the Annual Conference guide and inform the LGAQ's Annual Advocacy Plan and the LGAQ Policy Statement.\n",
    "[1290] \n",
    "[1291] Under the LGAQ Conference rules, any motion from a local government, must be endorsed by the submitting Council at a Council meeting. To be considered at the 2024 Annual Conference, all motions must be received by the LGAQ by 29 July 2024.\n",
    "[1292] \n",
    "[1293] The Conference agenda will prioritise motions that raise new issues of state-wide relevance or an issue impacting a large portion or segment of the LGAQ membership. Motions should not relate to a matter considered at a previous Annual Conference in the last five years, unless seeking to alter or update the adopted policy position. Motions must also be well formed and presented in a way that is most likely to garner the support of the broader membership of the LGAQ - namely the 77 local governments in Queensland.\n",
    "[1294] \n",
    "[1295] One motion is proposed for consideration by Sunshine Coast Regional Council to submit to the LGAQ for consideration and debate at the 2024 Conference. This motion - should it be endorsed by Council and subsequently resolved at the LGAQ Annual Conference - would provide greater impetus for introducing speed limitations for personal mobility devices.\n",
    "[1296] \n",
    "[1297] The details of the motion, including background information and desired outcomes, are outlined in Appendix A.\n",

    "[1836] \n",
    "[1837] The changes include significant requests by the Taskforce including the state-wide ban on restricted dogs, increased pins for attacks and state-wide effective control measures.\n",
    "[1838] \n",
    "[1839] The changes are in direct response to recommendations by the Animal Management Taskforce, with the work of the Taskforce continuing by mid-2024 to implement changes appropriately and progress further legislative changes in line. The call for better regulation for the breeding and sale of cats and dogs is included in the forward work program of the new Taskforce.\n",

    "[1869] \"DAF has just completed a comprehensive review of the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 (ACPA). The review which was conducted over the last two years included a significant stakeholder consultation process which resulted in over 2 500 submissions being received from individuals and organisations. As a result of the review, amendments were made to the ACPA by the Animal Care and Protection Amendment Act 2022 which commenced on 12 December 2022. Overall, the review of the ACPA found that the framework of the Act sets appropriate standards for the care of animals and penalties for breaches of those standards. Section 17 of the ACPA imposes a duty of care on a person that is in charge of an animal to ensure the animal is provided with appropriate food, water, shelter and treatment. The duty of care covers any animal that is in the care of a person including animals kept for breeding. The maximum penalty for a breach of duty of care is 300 penalty units or one year imprisonment. A recent amendment to section 17 means that if the breach causes death, serious deformity, serious disability or prolonged suffering of the animal, the maximum penalty is 2000 penalty units or three years imprisonment. Schedule 3A of the Animal Care and Protection Regulation 2012 contains the Code of Practice for breeding of dogs which imposes specific duty of care requirements on a person in charge of a breeding dog and a relevant puppy and a premises used for breeding a dog and a relevant puppy. These requirements include the provision and accessibility of food, water, enrichment, health inspections and veterinary care. At the request of LGAQ in late 2021, DAF commenced a limited scope, 'targeted' review of the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008. The review is in response to issues raised by local governments and their communities concerning restricted and dangerous dogs, public safety, animal management enforcement and related matters. The review terms of reference, agreed to by LGAQ and nominated Council representatives, doesn't provide for a review of the entire Act.

    "[1905] ## PURPOSE\n",
    "[1906] \n",
    "[1907] This report seeks Council's approval for Mayor Natoli to undertake overseas travel from 4 to 14 February 2025 to participate in the Council of Mayors South East Queensland (CoMSEQ) delegation to Singapore, Manchester and Paris.\n",
    "[1908] \n",
    "[1909] The Mayor's participation in this delegation cannot be confirmed until authorisation to undertake the overseas travel has been provided by Council.\n",
    "[1910] \n",
    "[1911] \n",
    "[1912] ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
    "[1913] \n",
    "[1914] At its Board Meeting on 10 May 2024, COMSEQ endorsed its 2024-25 Strategic Action and Advocacy Plan. The proposed international delegation to Singapore, Manchester and Paris forms part of that Plan and aims to increase global awareness of the South-East Queensland region and to promote trade and investment opportunities. Missions such as this also provide excellent opportunities for the Mayors of South-East Queensland to discuss regional priorities and develop relationships.\n",
    "[1915] \n",
    "[1916] While the delegation has been approved by the CoMSEQ Board, at the time of writing this report, which local governments are participating is not yet confirmed. All 11 Mayors that comprise the CoMSEQ Board have been invited and have indicated a willingness to participate.\n",
    "[1917] \n",
    "[1918] COMSEQ confirmed that it will meet the costs of the Mayor's travel, including economy class flights, accommodation, transfers and meals.\n",
    "[1919] \n",
    "[1920] The focus areas of the proposed delegation program are aligned to Council's regional strategies, Corporate Plan and Operational Plan. The learnings, relationships and strategic connections that could be established from participating in this delegation are potentially considerable, particularly given Council's role as a key delivery partner for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the opportunities and potential challenges this may afford.\n",
    "[1921] \n",
    "[1922] The purpose of the mission is to:\n",
    "[1923] \n",
    "[1924] 1\\. Investigate how city regions leverage major events to advance their global identity; and\n",
    "[1925] \n",
    "[1926] 2\\. Explore inter-governmental initiatives that promote greater investment while balancing the competing interests from other levels of government, including:\n",

    "[2235] \n",
    "[2236] This report seeks Council consideration and endorsement of recommendations for the 2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program (Appendix A).\n",
    "[2237] \n",
    "[2238] \n",
    "[2239] ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
    "[2240] \n",
    "[2241] The inaugural Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program and supporting guidelines were endorsed by Council at its Ordinary Meeting of 2 February 2011. The funding program commenced in the 2011/12 financial year providing funding for up to three years to successful applicants.\n",
    "[2242] \n",
    "[2243] On 20 June 2013, Council adopted the Community Grants Policy under which the Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program guidelines are administered.\n",
    "[2244] \n",
    "[2245] The aim of this program is to contribute to maintenance costs incurred by, and provide expert advice to, organisations maintaining turf surfaces to competition standard.\n",
    "[2246] \n",
    "[2247] The program is jointly managed by the Economic and Community Development and Built Infrastructure Groups and is premised on the following four elements:\n",
    "[2248] \n",
    "[2249] • The sports field maintenance undertaken ensures fields are at competition standard.\n",
    "[2250] \n",
    "[2251] • The costs are attributed per field, per annum and based on the type of sport played.\n",
    "[2252] \n",
    "[2253] • Council's contribution to the maintenance costs is a percentage of the full contractor rate.\n",
    "[2254] \n",
    "[2255] •\n",
    "[2256] \n",
    "[2257] The program is not applicable to specialised, exclusive and/or restricted access sports.\n",
    "[2258] \n",
    "[2259] Pivotal to the program is the availability of a dedicated Council staff member, Parks Community Sports Field Officer (Parks and Gardens), to provide support to sporting organisations by providing expert advice on maintaining their sports field to competition standard.\n",
    "[2260] \n",
    "[2261] There is one Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program round per year. The program has existing commitments to 48 sporting organisations that were awarded multiple years of funding in the 2023 round.\n",
    "[2262] \n",
    "[2263] Applications for the 2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program round closed on 27 May 2024 with one organisation applying to enter the program and one of the existing partner organisations requesting a variation to their funding agreement to include maintenance of an additional field.\n",

    "[2274] \n",
    "[2275] This report recommends a total of $15,444 in funding for 2024/25 and $18,620 plus annual CPI in 2025/26 to applicant organisations as follows:\n",
    "[2276] \n",
    "[2277] • $3,176 in 2024/25 and $6,352 plus annual CPI in 2025/26 for Nirimba Hurricanes Junior Rugby League Club to join the program, taking responsibility for new fields in Nirimba from March 2025.\n",
    "[2278] \n",
    "[2279] • an increase of $12,268 in 2024/25 and $12,268 plus annual CPI in 2025/26 to the existing allocation to the Coolum Cricket Club Inc towards costs of maintaining an additional field at Keith Royal Oval, Marcoola.\n",
    "[2280] \n",
    "[2281] Details of this recommendation are provided in Appendix A.\n",
    "[2282] \n",
    "[2283] \n",
    "[2284] ## OFFICER RECOMMENDATION\n",
    "[2285] \n",
    "[2286] That Council:\n",
    "[2287] \n",
    "[2288] (a) receive and note the report titled \"2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program\" and\n",
    "[2289] \n",
    "[2290] (b) endorse the 2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program Recommendations including two years of funding with annual CPI increases to be applied in 2025/26 (Appendix A).\n",
    "[2291] \n",
    "[2292] \n",
    "[2293] ## FINANCE AND RESOURCING\n",
    "[2294] \n",
    "[2295] Funding of sporting organisations through the Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program is based on a formula which considers field type, number of fields and period of responsibility and is allocated (subject to budget) for one-, two- or three-year funding periods.\n",
    "[2296] \n",
    "[2297] The 2024 round is the second of the current three-year cycle. There are existing commitments of $943,991 to 48 sporting organisations that were awarded multiple years of funding in the 2023 round.\n",
    "[2298] \n",
    "[2299] It was determined that a maximum of two years of funding will be allocated in the 2024 round to bring the new allocations into line with existing Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program agreements which end on 30 June 2026.\n",
    "[2300] \n",
    "[2301] The 2024/25 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program budget is sufficient to support:\n",
    "[2302] \n",
    "[2303] • $3,176 for Nirimba Hurricanes Junior Rugby League Club to join the program.\n",
    "[2304] \n",
    "[2305] • An increase of $12,268 to the existing agreement with Coolum Cricket Club Inc to include responsibility for the maintenance of an additional cricket field - the Keith Royal Oval, Marcoola.\n",
    "[2306] \n",
    "[2307] • $943,991 that will be distributed to organisations already committed under multi-year agreements from the 2023 round.\n",
    "[2308] \n",
    "[2309] All applicants are recommended for two years of funding with an annual CPI increase in year two.\n",
    "[2310] \n",
    "[2311] As funding is allocated for the two (2) year funding period, the recommendations in this report have implications for future budgets (see Table 1 below).\n",

    "[2390] \n",
    "[2391] ## PROPOSAL\n",
    "[2392] \n",
    "[2393] The 2024 round is the second of the current three-year cycle. The program has existing commitments to 48 sporting organisations that were awarded multiple years of funding in the 2023 round.\n",
    "[2394] \n",
    "[2395] Opening on 22 April, the 2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program round was promoted through direct contact with organisations identified as potentially eligible for funding as well as through Council's Grants eNews and public website.\n",
    "[2396] \n",
    "[2397] Applications for the 2024 Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program round closed on 27 May with one (1) organisation applying to enter the program, and one (1) current partner organisation seeking an additional funding allocation to take on responsibility for an additional sports field. Both applicants requested two years of funding.\n",
    "[2398] \n",
    "[2399] The assessment of applications for this funding program required clarification of tenure, type of sport played on the field/s, number of fields and period of maintenance responsibility. An assessment panel made up of Council officers with relevant expertise met to review the applications and determine an outcome. Assessment panel membership is detailed in the Internal Consultation section of this report.\n",
    "[2400] \n",
    "[2401] This report recommends a total of $15,444 in funding for 2024/2025 and $18,620 plus annual CPI in 2025/2026 to the two applicant organisations as follows:\n",
    "[2402] \n",
    "[2403] • $3,176 in 2024/25 and $6,352 plus annual CPI in 2025/26 for Nirimba Hurricanes Junior Rugby League Club to join the program, taking responsibility for two new rugby fields in Nirimba for part of the year from March 2025. This club will maintain the fields for three (3) months during 2024/25 and six (6) months during 2025/26. It is anticipated that a summer sports club will take over responsibility for the remaining six (6) months of 2025/26.\n",
    "[2404] \n",
    "[2405] • an increase of $12,268 in 2024/25 and $12,268 plus annual CPI in 2025/26 to the existing allocation to the Coolum Cricket Club Inc towards costs of maintaining an additional field at Keith Royal Oval, Marcoola. This club will have responsibility for maintaining the additional cricket field for a full 12 months each year.\n",
    "[2406] \n",
    "[2407] Details of this recommendation are provided in Appendix A.\n",
    "[2408] \n",
    "[2409] \n",
    "[2410] ## Legal\n",
    "[2411] \n",
    "[2412] The act of providing funding does not, of itself, raise issues of legal liability for Council. Rather it is the conduct of the funding recipient in carrying out what may be considered a local government type activity on local government owned or controlled land that will have some legal liability exposure issues for Council.\n",
    "[2413] \n",
    "[2414] This will be mitigated, as best as is possible, by having the successful funding applicants enter into Agreements that clearly articulate the relationship between the parties and obligate them to be incorporated bodies with adequate risk management plans, levels of insurance, training, reporting and financial controls.\n",
    "[2415] \n",
    "[2416] \n",
    "[2417] ## Policy\n",
    "[2418] \n",
    "[2419] Delivery of the Sports Field Maintenance Funding Program is governed by the Community Grants Policy and supporting guidelines.\n",

    "[2431] Risk\n",
    "[2432] \n",
    "[2433] There is minimal financial risk associated with the program in supporting identified eligible organisations to carry out field maintenance, due to the ongoing working relationships between the organisations and dedicated Council officers. This relationship is supported by individually tailored funding agreements.\n",

    "[2567] \n",
    "[2568] In accordance with Local Government Regulation 2012, this report seeks Council's endorsement to provide an exception to the tender or auction process for disposing of an interest in land. The purpose of which is to facilitate a lease with Police Citizens Youth Clubs Queensland (PCYC) for the development of a community facility in Bells Creek.\n",
    "[2569] \n",
    "[2570] \n",
    "[2571] ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
    "[2572] \n",
    "[2573] Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC) Queensland is a charity providing youth and community programs, services and facilities across Queensland. The organisation partners with Queensland Police Service to focus on personal and leadership development of young people, through activities and programs delivered over 56 facilities across the State.\n",
    "[2574] \n",
    "[2575] During the latter half of 2023, Police Citizens Youth Club began discussions with Council and Stockland regarding opportunities for establishing a community facility in Caloundra South. Police Citizens Youth Club expressed specific location requirements to fit its business model. These site requirements included a location that is well serviced by public transport, has close proximity to activity centres and importantly, close proximity to a police station.\n",
    "[2576] \n",
    "[2577] Police Citizens Youth Club have identified a 6500m2 area of land to the east of the Emergency Services Precinct in the future Aura Town Centre that is desirable for their purpose. The site is proximate to a future police station, fire station, ambulance station and the future Aura Train Station.\n",
    "[2578] \n",
    "[2579] However, the site does not form part of the planned community facilities network to be created and contributed to Council as part of the Aura development. The site is an opportunistic prospect identified by Police Citizens Youth Club.\n",
    "[2580] \n",
    "[2581] Stockland are agreeable to the subject land being used for Police Citizens Youth Club's proposal but this will necessitate a redistribution of planned community facility sites within the broader Aura development. Council's Open Space & Social Policy team have reviewed the proposal to identify any impacts to the provision of future community facilities in the network, confirming that two planned neighbourhood meeting room sites and one planned local community centre site could instead be delivered as a single facility on the 6,500m2 site within the future town centre. The proposal by Police Citizens Youth Club does not adversely impact the overall community facilities network as there will be no net loss of community facilities land. To ensure that the endorsed community facility network outcomes are achieved, it would be anticipated that the Police Citizens Youth Club development integrates flexible and multipurpose bookable spaces in accordance with Council's minimum Desired Standards of Service requirement for local community venues.\n",

    "[2591] <!-- PageHeader=\"24 JULY 2024\" -->\n",
    "[2592] \n",
    "[2593] The proposal to site the Police Citizens Youth Club facility in the town centre, including a redistribution of sites within the community facilities network will require an amendment to the Caloundra South PDA Infrastructure Agreement (Local Government Infrastructure) 2015 (the \"IA\"). This amendment can be progressed as a Deed of Variation to the IA.\n",
    "[2594] \n",
    "[2595] The Deed of Variation will ultimately be executed by Stockland, Council and Economic Development Queensland (EDQ) as parties to the IA. It is noted that Economic Development Queensland have given 'in principle' support for the Deed of Variation, given its minor nature.\n",
    "[2596] \n",
    "[2597] Once the lot is created, it is intended to be transferred to Council under a nomination of trust, which will enable Council to enter into a long-term community lease to facilitate third party capital investment. The final leasing terms between Council and Police Citizens Youth Club are yet to be negotiated, finalised and executed.\n",
    "[2598] \n",
    "[2599] The Local Government Regulations 2012 prescribe that Council must dispose of an interest in land (including a lease) in a particular way, being via tender or auction. However, there are exceptions to this requirement should Council agree by resolution that the exception applies. Section 236(1)(b)(ii) of the Local Government Regulations 2012 states that a relevant exception to dispose of an interest in land, other than by tender or auction, may apply where the disposal is to a community organisation.\n",
    "[2600] \n",
    "[2601] Important considerations for this proposal are as follows:\n",
    "[2602] \n",
    "[2603] • Police Citizens Youth Club is a community organisation,\n",
    "[2604] \n",
    "[2605] • The proposal has been initiated by Police Citizens Youth Club for land identified by them as suitable, and confirmed by relevant Council teams as feasible within the planned community facilities network,\n",
    "[2606] \n",
    "[2607] • The site has unique attributes that meets Police Citizens Youth Club's operating model, including proximity to a police station,\n",
    "[2608] \n",
    "[2609] • Police Citizens Youth Club have demonstrated a funding mechanism for delivery of the community facility.\n",
    "[2610] \n",
    "[2611] \n",
    "[2612] ## OFFICER RECOMMENDATION\n",
    "[2613] \n",
    "[2614] That Council:\n",

    "[2634] \n",
    "[2635] This proposal seeks to deliver a contemporary community facility on community purpose land at no cost to Council. Council is making a land contribution only (by way of a peppercorn lease) and will have no ongoing operating expenses attributed to the facility. The Queensland Government has publicly announced $15 million in funding for a new Police Citizens Youth Club facility in Caloundra.\n",

However, during June and July 2022, Council undertook a community engagement program (\"Our People, Our Place, Our Aura\") to understand the local community's values and vision, opportunities and challenges, and ideas to build a vibrant and connected community. It also investigated what community facilities, programs and activities people would like available locally. While community venues were not highlighted as a current priority for participants, a desire was expressed for places and spaces for the community to come together.\n",

    "[2701] ## PROPOSAL\n",
    "[2702] \n",
    "[2703] Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC) Queensland is a charity providing youth and community programs, services and facilities across Queensland. The organisation partners with Queensland Police Service to focus on personal and leadership development of young people, through activities and programs delivered across 56 facilities across the State.\n",
    "[2704] \n",
    "[2705] A Police Citizens Youth Club facility typically consists of spaces designed to provide youth and community programs often delivered through sport, fitness, dance, wellbeing initiatives and after school care. The proposed Club will support community safety and encourage an active and healthy lifestyle providing a number of benefits to the local and surrounding growing community:\n",
    "[2706] \n",
    "[2707] These include a range of programs that are available at no charge to young people and their families including basketball and or boxing after dark, youth leadership team, youth drop in, and brake the cycle driver mentoring program. The facility will also consist of a multi-purpose space for community sport and recreation hire.\n",
    "[2708] \n",
    "[2709] During the latter half of 2023, Police Citizens Youth Club began discussions with Council and Stockland regarding opportunities for establishing a community facility in Caloundra South. Police Citizens Youth Club expressed specific location requirements to fit its business model. These site requirements included a location that is well serviced by public transport, has close proximity to activity centres and importantly, close proximity to a police station.\n",
    "[2710] \n",
    "[2711] Recently, Council has prepared an Expression of Interest package for five parcels of land designated for community facilities throughout the Aura development. The Expression of Interest sought activation of the five sites, located in Baringa and Nirimba, through partnership opportunities with community providers.\n",
    "[2712] \n",
    "[2713] After some consideration, Police Citizens Youth Club advised Council that none of the five sites included in Council's Expression of Interest package were suitable as they did not meet their location requirements. However, Police Citizens Youth Club have identified a 6500m2 area of land to the east of the Emergency Services Precinct in the future Aura Town Centre that is desirable for their purpose. The site is proximate to a future police station, fire station, ambulance station and the future Aura Train Station (planned as part of the Queensland Government's Direct Sunshine Coast Rail Line). A map of the nominated site, described as proposed Lot 8048, is shown in Figure 1.\n",

    "[3024] \n",
    "[3025] Council has been a key strategic partner in the development and resultant success of the Sunshine Coast Lightning netball team for the past eight years. Council approved a three- year sponsorship agreement with Sunshine Coast Lightning in 2016, supplying both financial, practical and strategic support for the development of Australia's newest professional sports team.\n",
    "[3026] \n",
    "[3027] In 2019, as the terms of the initial contract were reaching a conclusion, Council approved a two-year extension to the sponsorship agreement for the same investment.\n",
    "[3028] \n",
    "[3029] In 2021, as the terms of the 2021-2022 agreement were reaching a conclusion, Council approved a three-year extension to the sponsorship for the 2023-2024 seasons.\n",
    "[3030] \n",
    "[3031] This current agreement will expire at the conclusion of the 2024 season, which commenced in April 2024 and concludes with finals rounds held in August 2024.\n",
    "[3032] \n",
    "[3033] Council has received a proposal and request from Sunshine Coast Lightning for the continuation of the sponsorship agreement for a further three seasons (2025-2027) to continue the partnership to achieve further on and off field successes and secure the club's future.\n",

    "[3045] Sunshine Coast Lightning commenced playing in the Australian Super Netball Championship's first season in 2017, becoming the most successful start-up sporting franchise in Australia's history by winning the premiership in their first two seasons (2017 and 2018), and continuing to be successful on court, competing in the Super Netball Finals in 2019 and 2020.\n",
    "[3046] \n",

    "[3120] ## PROPOSAL\n",
    "[3121] \n",
    "[3122] Council's initial support for the formation of Sunshine Coast Lightning in 2016 was based on the following assumptions and proposed benefits:\n",
    "[3123] \n",
    "[3124] 1\\. The growing awareness and recognition of Sunshine Coast as one of Queensland's and Australia's premier regional major events and sporting destination;\n",
    "[3125] \n",
    "[3126] 2\\. The enhancement of female sports on the Sunshine Coast and the increased community linkages by hosting our first national sporting team;\n",
    "[3127] \n",
    "[3128] 3\\. The ability to access State, Federal and Netball Australia funding for 'grass-roots' sports programs and infrastructure;\n",
    "[3129] \n",
    "[3130] 4\\. The ability to use the national sporting team presence to identify infrastructure gaps and secure funding for future sporting infrastructure needs on the Sunshine Coast;\n",
    "[3131] \n",
    "[3132] 5\\. The opportunity for tourism/sport leveraging in key target markets around Australia and New Zealand and increased linkages/performance between sports and tourism;\n",
    "[3133] \n",
    "[3134] 6\\. The ability to promote/market the Sunshine Coast to a national audience on television and print media that does not currently exist;\n",
    "[3135] \n",
    "[3136] 7\\. The potential for the Sunshine Coast to host the national/international \"Netfest\" Netball Australia competition at the Maroochydore Multi-Sports Complex; and\n",
    "[3137] \n",
    "[3138] 8\\. Securing our first national sporting team sets the stage for the Sunshine Coast over the next decade to build a business case to secure additional national sporting teams to be based in the region.\n",
    "[3139] \n",
    "[3140] In addition, the economic benefits of securing a national netball league on the Sunshine Coast were modelled by AEC Group who determined that a professional netball team based in the region would generate:\n",
    "[3141] \n",
    "[3142] • an estimated $4.9 million economic impact on the local economy, and\n",
    "[3143] \n",
    "[3144] • $249,000 in visitor spend benefits from visiting teams and spectators annually.\n",
    "[3145] \n",
    "[3146] In 2019, as the terms of the initial contract were reaching a conclusion, Council approved a two-year extension to the sponsorship with the same legacy benefit targets - as robust and significant gains had been achieved in all eight strategic categories.\n",

    "[3157] \n",
    "[3158] In 2021, as the terms of the two-year extension were reaching a conclusion, Council approved a three-year extension (2022-2024). This contract was at an increased investment which saw Council receive significant increases to its contractual benefits received from the Lightning. These benefits focused on greater community engagement and facilitated Councils ability to amplifying community programs via Lightning ambassadors. These programs included, but weren't limited to, domestic & family violence prevention awareness, beach safety, and responsible pet ownership.\n",
    "[3159] \n",
    "[3160] The current contract is set to expire at the conclusion of the 2024 season. As the Partnership matures and extends into its ninth year, Council's key objectives have evolved beyond the initial partnership legacy benefits. Key considerations when assessing the partnership renewal is the regions status as a delivery partner of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the legacy infrastructure that is associated with the Games and the opportunity for the Lightning to become an anchor tenant of the new indoor arena plus the region becoming a UNESCO Biosphere. When assessing the extension of the partnership, the desired 2025- 2027 strategic outcomes now include:\n",
    "[3161] \n",
    "[3162] 1\\. Optimise the national exposure of the Sunshine Coast region as a tourism destination through the audience and media reach of the high performing Sunshine Coast Lightning team;\n",
    "[3163] \n",
    "[3164] 2\\. Optimise the national awareness and exposure of the Sunshine Coast region as a UNESCO Biosphere and the uniqueness of the Sunshine Coast Lightning being the only professional sporting team to operate within a Biosphere. Leverage the partnership and promote Council's support in assisting the Sunshine Coast Lightning and Storm Group to become more sustainable and position the region as leaders and industry experts.\n",
    "[3165] \n",
    "[3166] 3\\. Assist Council to ensure as many opportunities as possible for local businesses to gain benefit through Sunshine Coast Lightning - as suppliers, sponsors or organisations that can promote their own growth and activity through the Sunshine Coast Lightning partnership;\n",
    "[3167] \n",
    "[3168] 4\\. Continue to leverage Sunshine Coast Lightning athletes to foster community engagement and pride;\n",
    "[3169] \n",
    "[3170] 5\\. Continue to foster youth involvement and developments via community engagement programs. The presence of successful athletes in the community has seen an increase in youth sports participation resulting in a range of social benefits;\n",
    "[3171] \n",
    "[3172] 6\\. The opportunity for tourism/sport leveraging in key target markets around Australia and New Zealand and increased linkages/performance between sports and tourism;\n",
    "[3173] \n",
    "[3174] 7\\. Continue to promote/market the Sunshine Coast to a national audience on television and print media;\n",
    "[3175] \n",
    "[3176] 8\\. Demonstration of Council's commitments to supporting professional sporting franchises positions the region in good stead to continue conversations with additional national and international leagues who have expressed interest in league expansion within the region; and\n",
    "[3177] \n",
    "[3178] 9\\. Communication and support for promotion of key Council messaging of all types to local fans and match audiences.\n",

    "[3190] Partnership History:\n",
    "[3191] \n",
    "[3192] Sunshine Coast Lightning commenced playing in the Australian Super Netball Championship's first season in 2017, becoming the most successful start-up sporting franchise in Australia's history by winning the premiership in their first two years (2017, 2018) and continuing to be successful on court competing in the Super Netball Finals in 2019 and 2020.\n",
    "[3193] \n",
    "[3194] In addition to their on-court success, Sunshine Coast Lightning has achieved excellent results for the region throughout the current partnership with Council such as:\n",
    "[3195] \n",
    "[3196] • Every home game at UniSC Arena selling out in 2017-2020 seasons (demonstrating very high levels of local and visitor support for the team), including more than 2,000 paid annual members;\n",
    "[3197] \n",
    "[3198] • Generating an estimated economic impact (both direct and indirect) for the region of over $100 million over the first five years ($20 million per season generated by visitation, local business development and national marketing and broadcast reach for the region) (Source: Lucid Economics);\n",
    "[3199] \n",
    "[3200] • Continually exceeding expectations of community engagement by the team - with Lightning players appearing for over 700 hours at community events during the 2023 season alone;\n",
    "[3201] \n",
    "[3202] • An average of 48,000 viewers per match for Sunshine Coast Lightning matches and a total season attendance at games of 16,083 during the 2023 season;\n",
    "[3203] \n",
    "[3204] • Active social media audience of 87,000 nationally (two thirds of which are from New South Wales and Victoria), receiving direct promotion of the Sunshine Coast region and a wide range of Council backed activities (such as tourism, events, investment or community); and\n",
    "[3205] \n",
    "[3206] • Sunshine Coast Lightning has major partnerships with local businesses based on the Sunshine Coast, who are achieving strong results in promotion of their products and services to a national audience.\n",
    "[3207] \n",
    "[3208] \n",
    "[3209] ## Legal\n",
    "[3210] \n",
    "[3211] There are no legal implications relevant to this Council report. Once a draft sponsorship agreement is prepared it will be referred to Legal Services for review.\n",
    "[3212] \n",
    "[3213] There are no barriers to entry or event obligations that would restrict access to a person or violate one of the 26 Human Rights.\n",

    "[3283] ## PURPOSE\n",
    "[3284] \n",
    "[3285] The purpose of this report is to seek Council endorsement to allow the Chief Executive Officer to finalise and execute a Funding and Performance Deed (the Deed) negotiated with Visit Sunshine Coast Limited, commencing from execution.\n",
    "[3286] \n",
    "[3287] Attachment 1 is confidential as it contains commercial in confidence information and confidential information relating to third parties. It also recognises that until Council makes a decision and a contract is executed, the content and timeframes are not final.\n",
    "[3288] \n",
    "[3289] For these reasons, it is recommended that should Councillors wish to discuss the information in the confidential attachment, Council resolve to close the meeting under section 254J(3)(g) of the Local Government Regulation 2012 as the attachment contains information on negotiations relating to commercial matters involving the local government for which a public discussion would be likely to prejudice the interest of the local government.\n",
    "[3290] \n",
    "[3291] Specifically, the matters that are considered confidential in the attachments and which would be the subject of discussion when the meeting is closed relate to the contract terms and conditions that are still the subject of negotiation with Visit Sunshine Coast Limited.\n",

    "[3293] \n",
    "[3294] ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
    "[3295] \n",
    "[3296] Tourism is an integral part of our visitor economy, one of six economies identified in the Regional Economic Development Strategy (REDS). On the Sunshine Coast, the tourism sector provides:\n",
    "[3297] \n",
    "[3298] • 9.3% of the Sunshine Coast Local Government Area's employment\n",
    "[3299] \n",
    "[3300] · An estimated 15,957 Full Time Equivalent jobs, 9,034 directly\n",
    "[3301] \n",
    "[3302] • Over $2.5 billion in visitor expenditure across the 2023 calendar year.\n",
    "[3303] \n",
    "[3304] Council's investment in the tourism industry occurs predominantly through two mechanisms: through the execution of the Sunshine Coast Major Events Strategy 2018-2028 and sponsorship of major events with the objective of driving visitation during low tourism periods; and Council allocates funds to the Regional Tourism Organisation (RTO), Visit Sunshine Coast who deliver destination marketing strategies, industry development programs and support to local business to help achieve agreed visitor expenditure and visitation targets. Visit Sunshine Coast is one of 13 Regional Tourism Organisations within Queensland and is currently ranked in the top three in terms of performance by Tourism and Events Queensland.\n",

    "[3317] \n",
    "[3318] Throughout the year, Visit Sunshine Coast is required to report back on a range of key performance indicators, culminating in an annual report presented to Council on the outcomes of Visit Sunshine Coast's Annual Tourism Plan each year.\n",

    "[3407] Community Engagement\n",

    "[3412] ## PROPOSAL\n",
    "[3413] \n",
    "[3414] Since 2012, as part of Council's agreement with Visit Sunshine Coast, a Funding and Performance Deed has been in place to ensure that Council receives strategic plans, budgets and reports to ensure the funding is used effectively and that Council is receiving value for ratepayer money. An updated Funding and Performance Deed was executed in 2018 with Key Performance Indicators running until the end of 2023 which are due for renewal. On 4 April 2023, Council signed a Heads of Agreement with Visit Sunshine Coast with guiding principles on how the new funding deed would be structured. This was also based on the Investment in Tourism Review that Council commissioned in 2021.\n",
    "[3415] \n",
    "[3416] The funding support of Visit Sunshine Coast is the main function that Council can perform to support an industry that drives economic growth and allows our visitor economy to continue to increase. The Regional Tourism Organisation model of destination marketing provides a region-wide focus, encouraging visitation from out of the region to all parts of the Sunshine Coast. On average, a visitor will spend $944 on their trip, staying on average 3.6 nights in region.\n",
    "[3417] \n",
    "[3418] Visit Sunshine Coast's vision is to lead the tourism industry in promoting the Sunshine Coast's offering as a destination utilising the regions natural advantages, and to build a sustainable sector that will maximise the long-term benefits of the visitor economy to the region. Visit Sunshine Coast align closely with Council's strategic priorities and work closely with Council to promote growth in a key sector identified in the Regional Economic Development Strategy (REDS).\n",
    "[3419] \n",
    "[3420] Key updates incorporated within the draft deed:\n",
    "[3421] \n",
    "[3422] • Changes to reporting templates to provide greater insights for Sunshine Coast Council, whilst supporting visitor economy growth.\n",
    "[3423] \n",
    "[3424] • Commitment to working through the recommendations from the Investment in Tourism Review.\n",

    "# PROPOSAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "The application seeks approval for a Development Permit for Material Change of Use of Premises to Establish an Extension to Tourist Attraction (Car Museum).\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal seeks a 4 storey, 32,019m2 gross floor area vintage car museum building providing 879 car display bays (including turntables), 363 motorcycle display bays, a lobby area, a special display zone, lifts and a partial upper-level viewing terrace. The proposed car museum represents an extension to, and relocation of, the existing approved tourist attraction (MCU12/0190).\n",
    "\n",
    "The vintage car museum, including the roof top terrace area, would be 18m high to the upper level of the building perimeter and 21.6m to the top of the roof terrace lobby and lift overruns from finished fill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approved Multi-Level Car Park on the adjoining site (Resort sub-Precinct 1B) has been included in the application to demonstrate the availability of onsite car parking for patrons visiting the Palmer Resort, golf course and/or car museum. The approval was issued on 9 January 2024 and provides 498 car bays plus 34 motorcycle parking spaces at the location of the existing at grade resort car park within Sub-Precinct 1B (resort car parking facility) at the Palmer Resort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle access to both the multi-level car park and vintage car museum is proposed from the main resort entrance from Warran Road and another existing entrance from Warran Road (currently used for back-of-house facilities). Pedestrian access to the car museum would be provided via one prominent entrance at the southwest ground floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing mature vegetation around the periphery of the resort would be retained to buffer and screen the proposal from external viewpoints and road. Additional landscaping is proposed along the front of the development, between the built form and the main internal private entry road to the resort. Additional landscaping is proposed along the eastern edge of the site to soften the built form and screen the structure.\n",
